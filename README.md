## R Framework for Climate Data Access and Post-processing <img src="/man/figures/climate4R_logo.svg" align="left" alt="" width="120" />

`climate4R` is a bundle of R packages for transparent climate data access, post-processing (including data collocation and bias correction / downscaling) and visualization. `climate4R` builds on two main data structures (grid and station, including metadata) to deal with gridded and point data from observations, reanalysis, seasonal forecasts and climate projections. It considers ensemble members as a basic dimension of the data structures. Moreover, `climate4R` is transparently (and remotely) connected to the Santander Climate Data Gateway, offering several state-of-the-art datasets (including CMIP5 and CORDEX subsets).

* `climate4R` is formed by the following four core packages (all in GitHub): [`loadeR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR) , [`transformeR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/transformeR), [`downscaleR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR) and [`visualizeR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR). These packages are fully documented in the corresponding GitHub wikis.

* `climate4R` capabilities are further extended by providing support to physical units handling ([`convertR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/convertR) package) and geoprocessing tasks ([`geoprocessoR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/geoprocessoR) package).   

* Compatibility with some external packages has been achieved by wrapping packages, thus enhancing `climate4R` with new functionalities (e.g. ETCCDI extreme climate indices via the [`climdex`](https://github.com/pacificclimate/climdex.pcic) package). 

* Semantic provenance (metadata) information for `climate4R` products can be generated using [METACLIP](http://www.metaclip.org) via the [`metaclipR`](https://github.com/metaclip/metaclipR) package.

* [Conda](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R/tree/master/conda) and [docker](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R/tree/master/docker) `climate4R` installations available. The [docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) file also includes the [jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest) framework. This is the base layer for the **climate4R Hub** (a cloud-based computing facility to run `climate4R` notebooks at [IFCA/CSIC Cloud Services](https://ifca.unican.es/en-us/research/advanced-computing-and-e-science)).

## Installation

### Direct package installation from github:

``` r
    > library(devtools)
    > install_github(c("SantanderMetGroup/loadeR.java",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/climate4R.UDG",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/loadeR",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/transformeR",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR",
                 "SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR"))
```

### Installation using miniconda:

[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is a free minimal installer for conda. Using the [conda recipe](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R/tree/master/conda) it is possible to install an up-to-date version of the different packages composing the `climate4R` framework, and all the associated library dependencies (udunits, openjdk, netcdf Java etc.), avoiding some possible problems like the R-java configuration etc. Note that the appropriate miniconda distribution must be installed before running the command (go to the [miniconda installers page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)):

```bash
# create a conda environment
conda create --name nameofmycondaenvironment
# activate the environment
conda activate nameofmycondaenvironment
# install climate4R
conda install -c defaults -c conda-forge -c santandermetgroup climate4r
```
Activate the conda environment to work with climate4R. To deactivate the environment run the following:

```bash
# deactivate the environment
conda deactivate nameofmycondaenvironment
```

### NOTE: installation of specific package versions

In case a particular paper notebook is to be replicated, the installation of specific version tags can be done by just explicitly indicating the tag number in the repo name. For example:

```r
   > devtools::install_github("SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR@v1.0.0")
```
installs the `visualizeR` package version used in Frías _et al._ 2018, while the following

```r
   > devtools::install_github("SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR@v1.4.6")
```
will install a more recent version of the package used in the paper by Iturbide _et al._ 2019.


## Example of use

Examples of use of the `climate4R` framework are given in the reference papers above. In the following we illustrate the main functionalities of `climate4R` with a simple example, consisting on **calculating an ETCCDI index (Summer Days) from bias corrected EURO-CORDEX data over Southern Europe.** More details at the [brief introduction to climate4R](/man/2018_ClimateInformatics_Gutierrez.pdf) document in the `man` folder and full code at the companion [jupyter notebook](/man/notebooks/climate4R.ipynb).

## User Support

Please note that the pool of people who can provide support for `climate4R` packages is very small and our time for support is limited. We don't necessarily have the capacity for long, open-ended user support. Please follow these basic guidelines before posting:

* Introduce the problem before you post any code
* Help others reproduce the problem
* Avoid sending the same question to multiple places

These [posting guidelines](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) at stackoverflow provide further recommendations on how to make a good question. If questions are kept short, specific and direct, there's a greater chance that someone will take on the ticket.
